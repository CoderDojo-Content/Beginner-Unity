1. Before you can start creating your game, you'll need to install Unity and get it setup on your computer. This might take a while, as it's a big download and install, so it's best to do it at home before the Dojo.
2. Go to [dojo.soy/getunity](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) and click on the "Download Installer" button.
3. Run the installer that downloads and follow the on-screen instructions, accepting all the default options.
4. Wait for the the download and installation steps to complete.
5. Start Unity and choose **New** to create a new project

6. When asked for a name for the project, call it "Beginner Unity Sushi" so it'll be easy to find later!
7. Click "Create Project" and wait for your project to appear on screen!
