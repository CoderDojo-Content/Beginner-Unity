1. By following these cards you're going to build a simple video game and learn the tools you can use to make that game bigger and more awesome!
2. You need to do a little setup now, before you get started making your game.
3. In the top-right corner of the Unity window you'll see a menu called "Layout". Click on it and pick "Default".
4. Now go to the menu bar (at the top of the screen if you're on a Mac, or at the top of the Unity window on a PC) and choose the "Assets" menu near the left. Go to **Create > Folder**, which means pick the "Create" option and then the "Folder" option in the menu that opens underneath. You'll be asked for a name for your new folder. Call it "Scenes".
5. You already have a scene, the game started with one. You just need to save it (**File > Save Scene as...**). You'll need to give the scene a name. Call it "MazeRoboBegins" and put it in the "Scenes" folder you just created (it's inside the "Assets" folder).
6. Now create your first object! Make a **Capsule** object (**GameObjects > 3D Object > Capsule**) to be the body of MazeRobo, your robot!
  
  Now select the **Capsule** by clicking on it. Look to the right and you should see loads of options and menus. This is called the **Inspector** and it's where you setup most of the objects in your game.
  
  You can rename an object by typing a new name in at the top of the inspector. Change the name of the **Capsule** to "MazeRoboBody" now.
